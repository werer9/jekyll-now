I"}<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I am an Engineering/Arts conjoint student at The University of Auckland.
I currently major in Chinese and specialise in Computer Systems Engineering.
Here I will talk about topics that are of interest to me such as language learning, culture, history or technology.
I may also write something a little different every now and again.</p>
