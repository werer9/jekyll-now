Many people are curious as to how I study chinese or what resources I use to improve my Chinese. To make this question easier for me to answer, I have created this page to list some of the resources I have used.

## Where to start?
Before I did anything in my Chinese study I learnt the basics of Chinese pronunciation. In China, non-Chinese people have a reputation for butchering the pronunciation of Chinese (e.g. using the wrong tones). To be understood in China, one must first know the pronunciation.

Once pronunciation is taken care of, I began learning the Hanzi, I used a book called Remembering the Hanzi by James Heisig but there are other ways to approach this massive task that I will list below.

After getting a basic grasp of the Hanzi, I began reading, this is by far the most effectice way to improve the number of Hanzi you can recognise and is an extremely effective way of building up vocabulary and grammar. Since you are able to see it in context by reading, vocabulary and grammar tend to be easier to remember.

## Pronunciation
To improve my pronunciation, I used Fluent Forever's Mandarin pronunciation trainer.\

I also have the Fluent Forever Mandarin Pronunciation Anki deck, feel free to DM me if you want it.

I would not recommend following any other advice from Fluent Forever as I quickly got bored of studying Chinese using their method.

## Hanzi
For learning Hanzi, I learnt using James Heisig's Remembering the Hanzi. This book uses a highly effective technique to help a new Chinese learner remember how to read and write the Hanzi, however, this method requires a lot of effort and time. In hindsight, it may only be worth doing 1000 of the characters in the book to get familiar with the basics of Hanzi and then moving on. I also didn't learn how to write the characters as I found this to be too time consuming.

Recently I have heard of a service called [Mandarin Blueprint](https://www.mandarinblueprint.com/) and many people have spoken highly of it. 

However, the best method to improve Hanzi recognition is actually to read which I will further elaborate on.

## Reading
The most effective thing you can do to improve your Hanzi recognition is to do a lot of reading.

For reading I reccoment the following resources to get started:
### Beginner
* John de Francis Beginning Chinese Reader (Traditional Characters)\
[ [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Chinese-Reader-Part/dp/0300020600) ] [ [UoA Library](https://catalogue.library.auckland.ac.nz/permalink/f/t37c0t/uoa_alma21122962490002091) ]
* [Mandarin Companion](https://mandarincompanion.com/) (Traditional and Simplified Characters)

### Intermediate 
* Twenty Lectures on Chinese Culture (Traditional Characters)\
[ [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Lectures-Chinese-Culture-Intermediary/dp/0300001274/ref=pd_sbs_2?pd_rd_w=HiARl&pf_rd_p=b65ee94e-1282-43fc-a8b1-8bf931f6dfab&pf_rd_r=J1ED30SGPQ3FDDKBB6QQ&pd_rd_r=fb7eb093-fcc8-4fc6-9b51-7027dd3c5e13&pd_rd_wg=6wxFR&pd_rd_i=0300001274) ] [ [UoA Library](https://catalogue.library.auckland.ac.nz/permalink/f/t37c0t/uoa_alma21166617260002091) ]

## Listening
I recommend beginning listening after learning pronunciation, in the beginning you should use English subtitles to stay entertained and then gradually easing into Chinese subtitles and then finally going without subtitles

I have so far watched the following:
* [降世神通 Avatar: The Last Airbender (Chinese dub)](https://v.qq.com/x/cover/m0t0ud0mjg6td5t/v00225ojbpd.html)
* [隐秘的角落 The Bad Kids](https://www.iq.com/play/2ffkwrzp4tg)
* [海绵宝宝 Spongebob (Chinese dub)](https://www.wekan.tv/child/301830268048001-161830268048001)
