If you have ever met me in real life, you may notice that my phone and laptop languages are Chinese. 
You may have even seen me reading the news in Chinese. Here is where I explain why I do this.

## Background

The Chinese language is diverse and ancient. While it takes on many spoken forms such as Mandarin (普通话) or 
Cantonese (广东话), the written Chinese language is standard throughout greater China. 
I am currently studying Mandarin, the lingua franca of modern China, and Modern Written Chinese.
Compared to English, the Chinese language is an entirely different beast. Rather than using an alphabet, 
Chinese uses logographs known as Chinese Characters or Hanzi (汉字). 
In terms of pronunciation, many phonemes are not present in English, and it is a tonal language.
Learning Chinese is no trivial matter, and unsurprisingly, the way I learn it is rather intense.

## My History with Chinese

### A Missed Opportunity

I was born and raised in Hong Kong. Unfortunately, I went to an international school where everyone speaks English, 
so I am still primarily a monolingual anglophone. After moving to New Zealand to school, 
I have been asked countless times if I can speak Cantonese or Mandarin. 
It quickly became apparent that I missed out on the opportunity to speak the second most 
common language in the world as a native. 
Unfortunately, my school in New Zealand didn't offer Chinese classes, 
so I shelved the thought until I got to University.

### Taking Classes

Luckily, my University offered Chinese courses, and I took it as my General Education course in my first year.
After two gruelling years of engineering, I realised that I wanted to study Chinese. 
Two years ago, I began taking Chinese as an Arts major alongside my Engineering degree. 
I quickly realised that classes would not get my Chinese to a level that I would be satisfied with. 
While the teachers are excellent, the courses progress pretty slowly.

### Immersion

Then, three weeks into my first semester of Chinese courses, lockdown hit. 
Suddenly, I had too much time on my hands and stumbled upon the idea of immersion learning. 
Rather than studying a language like another subject, one should acquire the language. 
This meant that learning or acquiring Chinese has to become a lifestyle if I ever want to reach a level that 
I am satisfied with. There is a misconception that language immersion can only happen in the country where the 
language is spoken; however, from my experience as a kid in Hong Kong, it's evident that this is not the case.

Since I was already taking classes, I simultaneously began making [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
decks to memorise vocabulary for my classes and began using Remembering the Hanzi by James Heisig to recognise the 
Chinese Characters. I then started using a premade Anki deck with lots of example Chinese sentences and learning to
understand them better. However, I still wasn't spending much time with the language. 
I eventually changed my phone and laptop languages to Chinese. However, I wasn't making many improvements. 
It became more apparent that learning this language would require a lot of 
investment and many years of exposure.

This year, Auckland went into a four-month lockdown, and I had too much time on my hands. 
This is when I first started immersing myself in the language and changing my lifestyle around it. 
I started watching Chinese dramas for several hours a day, learning new sentences from Chinese dramas in 
Anki and reading the news in Chinese. I also began tracking my hours spent in Chinese to keep me accountable. 
However, towards the end of lockdown, University got busy, and I have since stopped doing all of this.

## My Future with Chinese

This summer is looking to be quite busy and intense. I am starting to go to the gym and exercise regularly, 
working full time and taking summer school. I also think that I waste a lot of time and have enough time to work on 
something else. So I will also try to spend time on Chinese this summer. 
To hold myself accountable, I use [Toggl](https://toggl.com/track) to track my hours immersed in Chinese. 
To make use of my time more efficiently, I can do specific daily tasks that I usually do in English in Chinese. 
For example, rather than read the English news, read the Chinese news. This is much more difficult to do than in 
English, so I must do it every day until it becomes a habit, and I get used to reading in Chinese.

To force me to achieve all of this, I have set out the following goals for myself this summer. 
In this coming year, While I would ideally dedicate more time, habits need to be achievable and start with 
something manageable. After a month, I can continue trying to fit more exposure into my day.

To keep track of my experience, I will write a weekly update on how I am progressing and feeling.
