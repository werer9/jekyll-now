I'm told by some people that I have a lot of creative energy. After some thought, it has occurred to me that
writing about everything I go through might make this a lot easier. <!--more--> For those of you who don't know, I juggle many things in my life. This summer, I am working full time,
learning a foreign language, taking a summer school course, and finishing my Pilot's Licence. Meanwhile, I am also
trying my luck with dating.

In these posts, I will document my experience learning the Chinese language through immersion learning, how my
Pilot's Licence is progressing, and how I find time for everything. If you already know me, feel free to reach out and
give me some feedback or ask me questions about what I write.

Until next time :)<br>
